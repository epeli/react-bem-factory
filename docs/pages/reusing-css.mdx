# Reusing CSS

Whenever possible you should use the components for CSS reuse.

But sometimes one just needs share bits of common CSS between components and
BEMed embraces the nature of CSS for that with CSS selectors. So do not
create JavaScript variables with bits of CSS code and stick them to the
template literals.

Eg. this is bad

```tsx{2,4}{14,14}{21,21}
// XXX Bad code!
const common = `
    border-radius: 10px;
`;

const ButtonList = bemed({
    css: css`
        flex-direction: column;
    `,
    elements: {
        Save: bemed({
            as: "button",
            css: css`
                ${common} /* XXX Bad code! */
                color: green;
            `,
        }),
        Cancel: bemed({
            as: "button",
            css: css`
                ${common} /* XXX Bad code! */
                color: red;
            `,
        }),
    },
})("ButtonList");
```

It will not work with the Babel precompiler option and will duplicate styles
sent over the network when server-rendering critical CSS.

## Scoped CSS Selectors

Slightly better way to do this is to use the scoped CSS selectors

```tsx{4,6}
const ButtonList = bemed({
    css: css`
        flex-direction: column;
        button {
            border-radius: 10px;
        }
    `,
    elements: {
        // ...
    },
})("ButtonList");
```

But this is bit broad as it will match any buttons passed as the
`<ButtonList>` children.

We can use class names to be more specific

```tsx{4,6}{11,11}{18,18}
const ButtonList = bemed({
    css: css`
        flex-direction: column;
        .rounded {
            border-radius: 10px;
        }
    `,
    elements: {
        Save: bemed({
            as: "button",
            className: "rounded",
            css: css`
                color: green;
            `,
        }),
        Cancel: bemed({
            as: "button",
            className: "rounded",
            css: css`
                color: red;
            `,
        }),
    },
})("ButtonList");
```

## CSS Utility Classes

If you need to share CSS between different BEMed blocks you can just use
standalone CSS classes you have defined in some external stylesheet.

Multiple classes can be defined with arrays

```tsx{3,3}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: ["rounded", "button-font"],
    css: css`
        color: green;
    `,
});
```

For cconvenience a `createClassName()` helper is provided

```tsx{12,12}
import { createClassName } from "react-bemed/css";

const Rounded = createClassName(
    "rounded",
    css`
        border-radius: 10px;
    `,
);

const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: Rounded,
    css: css`
        color: green;
    `,
});
```

There are two benefits to using this helper as opposed to external classes.

1. TypeScript and ESLint will catch the error if you make a typo with variable name

2. Because BEMed creates these styles it can skip injecting them completely
   when doing critical CSS server-side rendering if they are not used in the
   initial render
