# Tailwind and CSS Modules

Since BEMed Components is a just fancy way to manage class names it works
really well with any CSS Framework that provides you a set of class names or
even generates those (CSS Modules).

## Tailwind

Here's how you would define a button with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which can be in two modes:

```tsx
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: ["border-solid", "border-8", "rounded-md", "p-3", "text-white"],
    mods: {
        mode: {
            normal: ["border-gray-600", "bg-gray-400"],
            danger: ["border-red-600", "bg-red-400"],
        },
    },
    defaultMods: {
        mode: "normal",
    },
});
```

When rendered without any props

```tsx
<Button>Click</Button>
```

it will get `className` of

```
border-solid border-8 rounded-md p-3 text-white border-gray-600 bg-gray-400
```

because we defined the mod `mode` to default to `"normal"`.

So when we render it with

```tsx
<Button mode="danger">Delete stuff</Button>
```

we would get

```
border-solid border-8 rounded-md p-3 text-white border-red-600 bg-red-400
```

Note how `border-gray-600 bg-gray-400` was removed and `border-red-600 bg-red-400` was added.

## CSS Modules

For CSS modules the situation is basically the same since it gives you an
object of class names

```tsx
import styles from "./button.module.css";

const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: styles.base,
    mods: {
        mode: {
            normal: styles.normal,
            danger: styles.danger,
        },
    },
    defaultMods: {
        mode: "normal",
    },
});
```
