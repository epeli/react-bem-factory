# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there IDE support?

Using tagged template literal named "css" for CSS strings in JavaScript is a
de facto standard so there are few tools that can take advantage of it:

-   VSCode [extension][styled-components] for Styled Components can provide
    syntax highlighting, auto-completion and linting for any tagged
    template literal named "css"
-   [Prettier][prettier] can format the CSS inside them and there's a VSCode
    [extension][vscode-prettier] for it (among other editors)

## Is there any examples?

This documentation site is styled using BEMed Components.

Check it out on Github

<https://github.com/epeli/react-bemed/tree/master/docs>

You might want to just start inspecting this site too see how what kind of
class names are being generated.

## How to add CSS autoprefixing?

CSS autoprefixing is enabled automatically in production builds.

## Why every component has a "bemed" class?

It can be used to change the base styles of the BEMed Components. For example
I like to design my site with a flexbox-first style so I add

```css
.bemed {
    display: flex;
    position: relative;
    flex-direction: column;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

If you're familiar with React Native this is basically same as the `View` component.

## Why the "css" is imported from the react-bemed/css entry?

It avoids adding extra weight to your bundle if you don't actually use it.

## Can I dynamically generate CSS based on the component props?

No. Dynamic CSS generation during rendering adds non-trivial complexity and
makes build-time optimizations harder with Babel. If you need dynamic styles
just use the `style` prop.

## Is it fast?

Should be. Maybe even blazing. I haven't made any benchmarks yet though.

But when comparing to similar tools
like Styled Components or Emotion: BEMed Components has a lot simpler runtime
because it does not support dynamic CSS generation or React Context based
theming. Basically all BEMed Components does during runtime is generating the
strings for the `className` props.

One could even say that BEMed Components is just a glorified version of the
[classnames][] module.

## What CSS preprocessor is used?

Stylis

## Should I use TypeScript?

Definitely.
